Managing metadata
=====================

Metadata means information describing data sets, services or instruments which make their Web discovery possible, and the associate data set more understandable. According to `INSPIRE Directive <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002>`_ metadata shall include different type of information about the data set, the service or the instrument considered such as the conformity with rules and standards, the conditions applying to access and use of information, the quality and validity, the public authorities responsible for their establishment, management, maintenance and distribution, and the limitation on public access. 

All these information need to be provided for the following categories:


1.	Data resources such as traditional spatial data (layers and maps) 
2.	Sensors (probe, buoys, glider, mooring, meteorological sensors, campaign measurements operators, human operators)
3.	Web services used to share spatial data on the Web

   
GET-IT SK allows the user to create metadata for 1 and 2 categories through different workflows and according to different profiles. 

`EDI metadata editor <http://edidemo.get-it.it/>`_ allows this operations and it is integrated in the GET-IT software suite but it could be used also as a stand alone tool.
